# Nobel Prize Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Nobel Prize data using a Jupyter Notebook to explore historical trends and patterns among Nobel laureates.  
The analysis focuses on understanding how Nobel Prizes have evolved over time across different categories, countries, and demographics.

The notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into:

- Distribution of Nobel Prizes by category
- Trends in Nobel Prizes over the years
- Country-wise and nationality-based analysis of laureates
- Gender distribution among Nobel Prize winners
- Repeated Nobel Prize winners and notable patterns
